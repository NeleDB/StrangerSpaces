# Stranger Things ft. Deep Learning

A personalized Stranger Things experience with deep learning (Style Transfer), WebVR and Three.js. The Style Transfer technique gives you the opportunity to view your own surroundings in the style of the Upside Down.

## Style training
We were not yet able to train our own style, because our GPU's weren't strong enough and we couldn't get our hands on a stronger computer. If you want to help us with the training send us a mail at either
lotte.bijlsma@student.howest.be or nele.de.bruycker@student.howest.be

For now the style used is a pretrained model.

## Credits

- Reiichiro Nakano for the his open source code, which has an implementation of the Fast Neural Style Transfer algorithm running fully inside a browser using the Deeplearn.JS library and which made it easy to use for us as web development students.
